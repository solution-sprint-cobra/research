The purpose of this repo is to explore the potential of technology, particularly mobile applications, in enhancing social interaction and support for children with disabilities. By examining the current profiles and discussing the unique needs and challenges faced by children with learning disabilities, this app aims to create inclusive and accessible spaces designed for their specific requirements.

> An effective method to illustrate the app's purpose is by showcasing real-world examples of the activities and spaces it facilitates.

## Yoga for children with learning disabilities

An example would be a **yoga program for children with learning disabilities**. This specialized approach combines yoga poses and mindfulness exercises to enhance physical **health and emotional well-being**, fostering confidence and relaxation in participants. [Here are some real-life events](https://github.com/solution-sprint-cobra/research/tree/main/images/yoga). And additional [papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165980/) to strengthen the idea.

## Disabled children and art

Another real-life example would be **art therapy for children** with disabilities, providing a creative environment for expression and healing. Through artistic activities for their abilities, children can experience enhanced self-esteem, emotional regulation, and communication skills. Art therapy encourages exploration, imagination, and self-discovery, fostering a sense of accomplishment and empowerment in children as they navigate their unique challenges. [Here](https://github.com/solution-sprint-cobra/research/tree/main/images/art) are some examples. And an additional [paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07421656.1993.10759018) to support the idea.

## Access-friendly walking tracks

Access-friendly walking tracks present another important example, offering children with disabilities the **opportunity to engage with nature and physical activity in a safe, inclusive environment**. These pathways promote not only physical health through gentle exercise but also mental **well-being by connecting children with the calming effects of the outdoors**. By providing a space where children can explore and move freely, access-friendly walking tracks support independence, social interaction, and a deeper appreciation for the natural world, enhancing the quality of life. Here are some example [images](https://github.com/solution-sprint-cobra/research/tree/main/images/outdoor-track/).
