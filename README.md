## Yoga for children with learning disabilities

An example would be a **yoga program for children with learning disabilities**. This specialized approach combines yoga poses and mindfulness exercises to enhance physical **health and emotional well-being**, fostering confidence and relaxation in participants. [Here are some real-life events](https://github.com/solution-sprint-cobra/research/tree/main/images/yoga). And additional [papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165980/) to strengthen the idea.

## Disabled children and art

Another real-life example would be **art therapy for children** with disabilities, providing a creative environment for expression and healing. Through artistic activities for their abilities, children can experience enhanced self-esteem, emotional regulation, and communication skills. Art therapy encourages exploration, imagination, and self-discovery, fostering a sense of accomplishment and empowerment in children as they navigate their unique challenges. [Here](https://github.com/solution-sprint-cobra/research/tree/main/images/art) are some examples.
